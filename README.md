# DataBase-Design-and-Implementation-Project
A customer uses the Manoosh Pizzeria's online ordering system to customise their pizza order, choose delivery, and pay for it in order to get ready for a gathering. The pizza ordering system is represented by 13 entities in the ERD, which are linked together for data management by relationships and attributes. Primary and foreign keys are used in the database design to preserve data consistency and avoid duplication, which makes it easier to track orders, customise them, offer promotions, and handle deliveries effectively. 
Here are the key findings of the report:
•	Data Consistency: Primary and foreign keys help to maintain data consistency.
•	Order Tracking: Order tracking is enabled, and it is thorough.
•	Customization: Customers have the option to customise orders.
•	Promotions: Specific orders may be linked to promotional deals.
•	Delivery Control: Effective delivery control is encouraged.
•	Employee structure: Manager and employee entities specify the organisational structure.
